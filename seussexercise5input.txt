In the town of Jig-Jag, on the banks of the Zee,
Lived a creature named Zibble, as odd as can be.
With a hat made of feathers and shoes that were green,
He was known as the Zibble, the Zee-walking fiend.

Now Zibble loved walking, he’d walk every day.
He’d walk in a zig, and he’d walk in a sway.
He’d walk on the water, he’d walk on the sand.
He’d walk on a rock with a fish in his hand.

One day while he walked, with his shoes on just right,
He saw a small sparkle, a glitter, a light!
It flashed and it fizzled, it flurried and flew,
And Zibble exclaimed, "What’s a walker to do?"

He followed the sparkle, he followed its trail,
Through thickets of thistles and the tail of a snail.
He walked through a puddle, he walked through a pit,
Till he found what was sparking: a Zoffler had lit!

The Zoffler was tiny, as small as a pea,
With a voice like a trumpet, as loud as could be.
It said, “You there, Zibble, I need you, you see,
To carry my sparkle across the great Zee!”

Bim-Bam the Builder was building a thing,
A thing with a twist and a swirly-swoop spring.
It clattered and clunked and it clinked and it clanked,
And for reasons unknown, it was brightly orange-painted.

Bim-Bam was clever, the cleverest yet.
He could build you a gizmo or fix a reset.
But this thing he was building? He hadn’t a clue,
What it did, what it meant, or what it might do.

"I’ll figure it out," said Bim-Bam with a grin,
"As soon as I finish this whatchamajig spin!"
He hammered and nailed, he bolted and glued,
He polished the sprockets until they all shooed.

Along came a bird with a hat full of stripes.
It squawked and it squabbled, it chirped some odd gripes.
"That thing you are building is causing distress!
I heard it went clatter near my feathered nest!"

"Clatter, you say?" Bim-Bam looked quite concerned.
"I only meant jingles and soft wheels that turned."
The bird flapped its wings and gave a loud squawk,
"Jingles? More like BOOMS that would wake up a rock!"

Bim-Bam just nodded and tightened some screws.
"I'll add some more buffers, soft cushions, and glue.
Now go, little bird, let me finish my thing!
When it’s done, you’ll hear music, no booms, just a ping!"

The bird wasn’t happy but flapped on its way.
And Bim-Bam kept working the rest of the day.
He twisted a spring and he polished a knob,
And he thought, "This might be my most wonderful job!"

But soon, from the forest, came a crowd with a roar:
There were bears, there were rabbits, and ten grumpy boars.
"What is that racket? What’s causing the fuss?"
"We can’t hear a thing! Not the breeze, not a bus!"

Bim-Bam looked sheepish, he rubbed at his chin.
"My invention’s too noisy; I must fix it again."
So he twiddled and tweaked, swapped the whizzer for quiet,
And stuffed all the gears with a muffling diet.

When at last he was done, all the animals cheered.
For his twisty-turn gizmo was no longer feared.
And as it turned softly, it made quite the show,
Shooting bubbles and sparkles wherever it’d go.

Now Bim-Bam’s invention, the Soft-Spinning Thing,
Was beloved by the forest for the joy it would bring.
And though he worked hardest to make it a hit,
He never did figure the purpose of it!

Deep in the valley of Thumpety-Thoo,
Lived a Snort named McBlort who had nothing to do.
His house was a jumble of sticks in a stack,
With a roof that was crooked and walls full of cracks.

“Oh, hum,” sighed McBlort, as he sat in his chair.
“My days are too dull; they’re as flat as a square.
I need an adventure, a quest, or a task!
Something exciting—no small thing to ask.”

So McBlort packed a bag with a spoon and a mop,
And he marched out the door with a jump and a hop.
He marched through the meadows, he marched through the fog,
Till he came to a tree with a sign: “DO NOT JOG.”

“Do not jog?” asked McBlort, scratching his nose.
“What could be so wrong with some jogging, I s’pose?”
But just as he questioned this curious sign,
The ground started shaking, and up came a vine!

This vine was enormous, it twisted and coiled,
It popped from the dirt like a kettle that boiled.
And on it there sat, in a chair made of string,
A creature quite odd with a voice like a ring.

“WHO DARES JOG HERE?” said the vine-sitting beast.
“Interrupting my nap and my mid-morning feast?”
McBlort stood up straight, though his knees gave a wobble.
“I’m McBlort from the valley of Thumpety-Thobble.

I seek an adventure, a task, or a goal—
Something exciting to make my life whole!”
The creature sat thinking, it scratched at its head,
Then it waggled its fingers and finally said:

“A quest, you say? Then a quest you shall take.
Go forth to Mount Murkle and find the Great Cake.
It’s hidden in caverns, deep under the stone,
Guarded by Snaggles with claws made of bone.

But beware of the Boofles, who gobble and chew.
They love to eat travelers like you!”

McBlort felt a shiver but puffed out his chest.
“Mount Murkle, you say? I’ll take on this quest!”
So off he went marching, his mop in his hand,
To conquer the mountain and make his bold stand.

The trail to Mount Murkle was rocky and steep,
With bridges that wobbled and ledges that weeped.
McBlort crossed a river on three floating logs,
Then he climbed a great hill filled with croaking green frogs.

At last, he arrived at the mountain’s gray base,
Where a Snaggle appeared with a frown on its face.
It was covered in fur that was knotted and thick,
And its claws, just as promised, were bony and quick.

“No further!” it growled, with a voice like a bark.
“You’ll not steal the Cake from the depths of this dark!”
But McBlort raised his mop and gave it a swing.
“Stand back, little Snaggle—I’ll take on this thing!”

The Snaggle was startled and leapt out of sight,
And McBlort pressed ahead through the cavernous night.
He followed a trail made of crumbs on the floor,
Till he came to a cavern with a great golden door.

The door was gigantic, with locks made of cheese,
And it creaked as it opened with the softest of wheeze.
Inside was the Cake, glowing bright on a plate,
With layers so tall they were bending with weight.

But just as he stepped to the cake for a bite,
The Boofles arrived in the dim candlelight.
They had eyes like big marbles and teeth sharp as nails,
And their growls filled the cavern with echoing wails.

“Who dares take our Cake?” said the Boofle in front.
“Turn back, little Snort, or you’ll bear the worst brunt!”
But McBlort, feeling brave, held his mop in the air.
“I’ve come all this way, and I’ve no time to spare!”

He swung at the Boofles, who scattered like leaves,
And one even tripped on the mop as it weaved.
They yelped and they tumbled, they howled and they ran,
Till the cavern was clear of the Boofle-filled clan.

With a cheer, McBlort grabbed the great towering Cake,
And carried it home to enjoy and partake.
He set it down proudly on his crooked old table,
And shared it with everyone, as much as he was able.

The creatures all gathered, from near and from far,
Even the Snaggle and Boofles (after their spar).
And McBlort sat smiling, his mop by his side,
For he’d found his adventure, and his heart swelled with pride.

And so in the valley of Thumpety-Thoo,
McBlort became famous, as heroes will do.
And though his old house stayed as crooked as ever,
His life was quite full and as bright as the weather.


Once in a town where the hills were all flat,
Lived a curious critter named Whimsy-Woo Sprat.
Her hair was a tangle, her shoes always laced,
And her nose was as freckled as a cinnamon paste.

Whimsy-Woo loved to make marvelous things,
Like whirligig wagons and parachute slings.
Her house was a jumble of gadgets and gears,
With some she had tinkered for hundreds of years.

One day, while she polished her Toodle-Tick-Tock,
(A contraption that danced like a wind-up peacock),
She heard a loud knock at her rickety door,
And there stood a Grink, looking lost and unsure.

The Grink had green fur and a hat with three bows,
And a backpack of snacks and a ring on his nose.
"Miss Sprat," said the Grink, "I’ve a riddle to pose:
How do you find where the Blue-Bonnet grows?"

"The Blue-Bonnet grows?" asked Whimsy-Woo Sprat.
"Is it real, or a dream, or a tale for a chat?"
"It’s real as the rain," said the Grink with a grin,
"And it’s hidden somewhere in the Land of Begin."

Now Whimsy-Woo loved a good quest, as you know,
So she grabbed her best hat and prepared to go.
She packed up her gadgets—her Beepity-Bling,
Her Whooziwig Wrench, and her Doo-Diddler String.

“Lead on, Mister Grink, to the Land of Begin!
We’ll find that Blue-Bonnet and bring it back in.”

They marched through a meadow of Pippity-Flowers,
Past Tick-Tocky Trees that chimed on the hour.
They climbed over mountains all covered in cheese,
And crossed wibbly-wobbly Milk-Melon Seas.

At last, they arrived at a bubbling brook,
Where a Snuzzle sat reading a very large book.
Its fur was like velvet, its eyes big and round,
And it hummed to itself as the waters swirled down.

“Excuse me, dear Snuzzle,” said Whimsy-Woo Sprat,
“We’re searching for something—can you tell us where that
Blue-Bonnet might be, the one bright and rare?”
The Snuzzle looked up and gave them a stare.

“The Blue-Bonnet’s tricky, it’s not easily seen.
It’s guarded by Blurgles, who live in between
The cliffs of the Twisty-Turn-Wibbly Flats,
Where the wind always whispers and tickles your hats.”

“Twisty-Turn-Wibbly?” the Grink scratched his chin.
“Then off we shall go to the Land of Begin!”
And so they continued through twists and through turns,
Where the sun never sets and the sky always burns.

At last, they arrived at the Twisty-Turn Flats,
Where the Blurgles were waiting with whistles and bats.
They were tiny and purple, with wings made of silk,
And they drank from the clouds like they’d sipped from warm milk.

“Who dares come this way?” said the biggest Blurgle.
“Turn back, little travelers, or we’ll make you gurgle!”
But Whimsy-Woo smiled and pulled out her string,
Her marvelous, magical Doo-Diddler String.

She plucked it and strummed it, she wove it in air,
Till music surrounded the Blurgles with care.
It twinkled and sparkled, it sang and it swirled,
And the Blurgles all giggled as they twirled and whirled.

“Alright!” said the Blurgles, “You’ve earned your right through.
The Blue-Bonnet’s there, past the next morning dew.”
And they pointed ahead where the cliffs dropped away,
To a valley below full of blossoms and sway.

Whimsy-Woo Sprat and the Grink found the flower,
The rare Blue-Bonnet, with magical power.
It shimmered and glimmered in moonlight and sun,
And its scent smelled of laughter, of joy, and of fun.

They picked it quite gently, then carried it back,
Through Twisty-Turn Flats and the wibbly-wobbly tracks.
When they reached Whimsy’s home, the town gathered near,
And the Blue-Bonnet sparkled for all to appear.

Its magic was simple—it made people smile.
It could brighten the gloomiest day for a while.
And the Grink gave a bow, and Whimsy-Woo Sprat,
Was hailed as the hero who’d done all of that.


Far up on the cliffs where the Ponderbreeze blows,
Lived a creature named Flipwick, with three curly toes.
His house was a mushroom as tall as a tree,
And he slept every night to the hum of the sea.

Flipwick was clever, but odd, some would say,
For he built silly things that would never obey.
Like his Splick-Splocker Cannon that spat out a tune,
Or his wobbling ladder that reached to the moon.

One morning, while sipping his Puffberry tea,
A letter arrived in his Mail-Eating Tree.
It chewed up the envelope, burped with a "POP,"
And spat out the letter with a singular plop.

“Dear Flipwick,” it read, “there’s a contest today!
The Great Zingledorf Race in the town of O’Flay.
Inventors are welcome to join with great cheer,
Bring your best gadget and meet us right here!”

Now Flipwick adored a good race, as you know,
So he sprang from his chair with a laugh and a glow.
“I’ll bring my Zippity-Zongle, my Fast-Wobble Rig,
And my brand-new invention—the Thunker-Big-Big!”

The Thunker-Big-Big was a marvelous feat,
With wheels made of rubber and seats that could tweet.
It rumbled and bumbled, it zipped and it zoomed,
And its horn played a polka that cheered up the gloom.

“Off to the race!” shouted Flipwick with glee,
As he loaded his gadgets aboard with a spree.
Through valleys and meadows, past Quibble-Quack Streams,
He zoomed to O’Flay, fueled by giggles and dreams.

In the square of O’Flay, where the banners were bright,
The inventors had gathered, all ready for flight.
There were Spindle-Machines and a Poppity-Gloop,
A self-flying teacup and one giant soup.

The mayor, a goose with a golden top hat,
Shouted, “Ladies and gents, now fancy that!
Today we shall race for the grandest of prizes:
A box of the rarest Giggle-Sized Surprises!”

The racers all lined up in neat little rows,
Adjusting their gadgets and tightening their bows.
“Ready, set, ZING!” cried the goose with a cheer,
And the crowd roared aloud as the racers changed gear.

Flipwick’s Thunker-Big-Big took the lead right away,
With its zig-zagging zips and its bright cabernet.
It twisted and turned through the Loopy-Loops track,
With a hiccup of bubbles that smelled like a snack.

But trouble arose at the Gumbuckle Curve,
Where a Spindle-Machine had begun to swerve.
It crashed with a clatter and blocked half the lane,
Causing Flipwick to wobble and nearly refrain.

“Oh dear!” he exclaimed, “But no time to stop!”
So he pressed his “Hop-Button,” and over the top
The Thunker-Big-Big gave a grand bouncing leap,
Clearing the blockage in one single sweep.

The race wasn’t over; the trickiest part
Was the Fizzy-Fizz Swamp with its ticklish start.
It bubbled and gurgled and tried to ensnare,
But Flipwick just laughed, for he didn’t much care.

He clicked on his “Splutterers,” fins made of glue,
That let him glide over the swamp like a canoe.
As others got stuck in the fizzy green goo,
The Thunker-Big-Big soared and broke right on through.

The finish line glimmered, not far from his sight,
But a competitor’s Cannon zoomed in from the right.
It was Snelly Von Sputz in her Wobble-Wheeled Jet,
And she looked like a racer not easy to forget.

The two neck-and-neck, with the crowd in a roar,
The Zingledorf Race was a sight to adore.
With one final burst from his Twiddler Exhaust,
Flipwick sped ahead, though his balance was tossed.

He crossed the big line with a boom and a thud,
And his Thunker-Big-Big slid into the mud.
The mayor declared, “Flipwick’s the champ of the day!
Here’s your Giggle-Sized Box—hip-hip-hooray!”

The prize was delightful, a box full of fun,
With candy that whistled and toys that could run.
But Flipwick just grinned as he gave it away,
To the kids of O’Flay, who had cheered all the day.

“I race not for prizes or fame,” Flipwick said,
“But the joy of inventing that swirls in my head.”
And with that, he zoomed home to his cliff by the sea,
Where he tinkered and dreamed with his Puffberry tea.


Down in the hollow where the Snufflebogs roam,
Lived a Grinkle named Wibber with no proper home.
He slept on a thistle, he dined on old cheese,
And he spoke to the wind through the Pumpernick Trees.

Now Wibber was happy, as far as things go,
But his life was quite quiet, and his days rather slow.
So one morning he stood with his feet in the dew,
And declared, “I shall do something splendid and new!”

He packed up a bundle of Dingledeed Fluff,
A canteen of nectar, and some Biscuit-Puff.
With a hop and a skip, he set off down the trail,
Humming a tune to the wag of his tail.

The trail wound through forests, past shimmery streams,
Through patches of sunlight and pockets of dreams.
But just as the Grinkle began to feel merry,
The ground gave a shake—and then came a berry!

A berry the size of a house, I should say,
That bounced and it rolled in a most frightful way.
“Great gibbets!” cried Wibber, as quick as a blink,
He dove in the hollow by a knobbly pink sink.

The berry rolled past with a thunderous roar,
And Wibber, though shaken, stood up to explore.
“That berry was massive! But what brought it here?
Is it magic, or mischief, or something unclear?”

He ventured on forward to follow the trail,
Through the Wobbleweed Glades and the Whispergrass Vale.
At last, he arrived at a curious sight:
A village of Zinks with their roofs painted white.

The Zinks were in panic; they shouted and ran,
For a second big berry came rolling like BAM!
“It’s the Great Berry Plague!” cried a Zink in despair.
“They’re bouncing and smashing and flying through air!”

Wibber approached with a confident grin,
“Perhaps I can help, for I’ve just wandered in.
But first, tell me truly, these berries so wild—
Have they always behaved in a manner so riled?”

“No, no!” said the Zinks, as they huddled in fright.
“They used to just grow, and they tasted all right.
But something has stirred them, made them go mad,
And now they’re destroying all the things that we had!”

Wibber scratched at his chin, and he gave it some thought,
Then snapped his long fingers—an idea he’d caught.
“I’ll visit the grove where these berries are born,
And see if the trouble can somehow be torn.”

The grove was a tangle of vines and of roots,
With berries as big as the bellies of newts.
And in the far center, a sight most bizarre:
A Berry-Boog Warden with a hat shaped like tar.

The Warden was juggling three berries on high,
While singing a tune to the clouds in the sky.
“Excuse me!” said Wibber, as brave as could be,
“Are you the one causing this great berry spree?”

The Warden turned slowly and gave a sly grin,
“I’m the Boog of the Grove, and it’s I who begin
The rolling and bouncing and berry commotion,
For fun is the juice that keeps life in motion!”

“But these berries,” said Wibber, “are causing such harm!
They’re wrecking the village and spreading alarm.
Surely there’s a way to make fun without pain,
To let laughter flow but keep chaos contained?”

The Boog tapped his chin, then he wiggled his toes,
And laughed, “You’re quite clever, dear Grinkle, who knows?
Perhaps we can channel this berry-bounce fun,
In a way that brings joy to both Zink and the sun!”

So Wibber and the Boog built a marvelous thing:
The Great Berry-Bounceer, with springs that could sing.
It captured each berry and flung it up high,
Where it twirled through the air like a pie in the sky.

The Zinks were invited to join in the game,
And they laughed and they cheered as the berries became
A sport for all ages, a jubilant spree,
With no more destruction, just good company.

Wibber was honored with hats made of fluff,
And a feast of the finest Biscuit-Puff.
But he waved it away with a humble decree,
“For me, just a hammock beneath a tall tree.”

And so Wibber returned to his thistle-topped hill,
With tales of adventure and memories to thrill.
The Boog stayed behind to keep berries in line,
And the Zinks lived in laughter, their days quite divine.

But as for our Grinkle, his story’s not done,
For somewhere out yonder, there’s more to be spun.
So next time you hear the wind hum through the trees,
Think of Wibber the Grinkle, and his Pumpernick Breeze.
